    "# Supernovae measurements to constrain cosmological parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will follow some steps of the paper written by Riess et al. about the measurements of Supernovae and their corresponding distance (modulus), which they used to infer cosmological parameters. You will read in the data from two .csv files, have a look at them and then quickly go about fitting different models to the observed data to infer e.g. the dark energy component of the universe. Riess was awarded a shared nobel prize for these findings, since this was the first hard proof of a significant dark energy density.\n",
